I began by developing a Twitter application and obtaining the necessary API keys and access tokens. Subsequently, I utilized the TextBlob and Tweepy libraries to analyze sentiment from a collection of tweets based on specific keywords. I also implemented a data cleaning process to enhance the accuracy of my analysis. Furthermore, I explored the challenges associated with sentiment analysis accuracy and strategies to mitigate potential positive bias in my results.
